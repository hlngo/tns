This is a derivation work from the original Market. It has more or less the same issues that the original work contains:
- The sequential RPC calls when collecting offer (registration_manager.py/make_offer)
- The unnecessary reservation phase

This modification changes/adds:
- Replace director.py by a function that initiates a new market cycle
- Inject clearing prices from external entities. Thus, removing clearing price calculation from original work.
- The role of this work is not a global service agent anymore. It is now served as a on-demand sub-market for a monolithic market designed by Don Hammerstron. Should we consider to break such monolithic market,  that's another big work...
